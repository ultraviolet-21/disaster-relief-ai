Inspirit AI project AI for Disaster Relief

# In 2022, I participated in the Inspirit AI Scholars program. As part of that program, I worked on the project
# AI for Disaster Relief. This project uses Python and sklearn to analyze data (in this case, tweets) in the 
# aftermath of a disaster. We encoded the tweets using one-hot encoding and used logistic regression to determine 
# how similar the words in one tweet were to another. We divided the tweets into four categories: food, water,
# energy, and medical. For this, we used specific keywords, and logistic regression helped to identify words that
# might be similar to them. By classifying these tweets into categories, we can simplify disaster relief efforts 
# because it's easy to determine what people need the most.
